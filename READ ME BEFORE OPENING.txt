Hey! My name is Ammar Ahmed Mohamed Taha, I'm 13 next month, and I love Coding.

My Main language in Coding is Python or Pygame library. I worked with other modules before but these are my main ones.
I made over six games, sometimes it worked others it didn't. But completely finished games are six that i attached to this file here.
This is acually a copy of the main file i use for coding! 

Another hint: please when you open the files open it with an IDE
(Like sublime text or visual studio code that i prefer to use for coding)

I started coding about two years ago, my first game was the Pong Game you can see here.
Then I wanted to make a Mario Ripoff that took me alooong time but is finally finished.
Then the other games.

Please Focus on the Chess Game, I worked on it day and night for 14 days, (two weeks)

Please keep in mind that all of these games were made by me learning by my sefl on youtube and that i have not taken any courses before.
(so these are from pure skill)


Thx, Ammar.
